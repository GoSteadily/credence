# Commercial License for *Credence*

The Business Source License 1.1 for *Credence* restricts two specific activities without a separate commercial licence:

1. **Direct reselling** — distributing, sublicensing, or otherwise charging a fee specifically for the Licensed Work itself or any derivative thereof.
2. **Paid agent/chatbot‑testing SaaS** — exposing the testing functionality of the Licensed Work (or a substantially similar capability) to third‑party users as a paid, monetised, or usage‑based hosted, cloud, or managed service.

If you require these rights, you must obtain a separate Commercial Licence from Steadily Consulting Inc.
